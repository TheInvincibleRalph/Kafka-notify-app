## Kafka Concepts: Partition and Offset

#### Partition

- **Partition**: 
  - Kafka topics are divided into partitions to achieve scalability and parallelism.
  - Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records.
  - Partitions enable Kafka to distribute data across multiple servers, allowing for high-throughput data processing.

  **Why Partitions are Important**:
  - **Scalability**: Distributing data across multiple partitions allows Kafka to handle more data and more consumers in parallel.
  - **Fault Tolerance**: Partitions can be replicated across different brokers to ensure data durability and high availability.

#### Offset

- **Offset**:
  - An offset is a unique identifier assigned to each record within a partition.
  - It represents the position of a record in a partition.
  - The offset is used by consumers to keep track of which records they have processed.

  **Why Offsets are Important**:
  - **Data Consistency**: Consumers use offsets to ensure they process each record exactly once.
  - **State Management**: By keeping track of offsets, consumers can resume processing from where they left off in case of failures.



## Handling signals

### Understanding `struct{}{}`

1. **`struct{}`**: 
   - `struct{}` defines an anonymous struct type with no fields. It's an empty struct.
   - In Go, `struct{}` is often used to indicate that no data is needed. This type takes up zero bytes of storage.

2. **`{}`**:
   - `{}` is used to create an instance of the `struct{}` type.

### Channel Usage

- **`doneCh <- struct{}{}`**:
  - This sends an instance of the empty struct to the channel `doneCh`.
  - Channels in Go can be used to signal events. By using an empty struct, you can signal without carrying any data.

### Why Use an Empty Struct?

1. **Efficiency**:
   - The empty struct `struct{}` uses zero memory. It's a minimal way to signal without overhead.
   
2. **Clarity**:
   - Using an empty struct in a channel can clearly indicate that the channel is used for signaling only, not for passing data.

### Example Context

In the provided code, `doneCh` is a channel used to signal the end of processing:

```go
doneCh := make(chan struct{})

go func() {
    for {
        select {
        case err := <-consumer.Error():
            fmt.Println(err)
        case msg := <-consumer.Messages():
            msgCount++
            fmt.Printf("Received message Count: %d: | Topic (%s) | Message (%s)\n", msgCount, string(msg.Topic), string(msg.Value))
        case <-sigchan:
            fmt.Println("Interruption detected")
            doneCh <- struct{}{}  // Signal done
        }
    }
}()

<-doneCh  // Wait for the signal
fmt.Println("Processed", msgCount, "messages")
if err := worker.Close(); err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Channel Declaration**:
   ```go
   doneCh := make(chan struct{})
   ```
   - `doneCh` is a channel that can carry empty struct values.

2. **Signaling Completion**:
   ```go
   doneCh <- struct{}{}
   ```
   - When an interruption is detected (`case <-sigchan`), an empty struct is sent to `doneCh` to signal that processing should stop.

3. **Waiting for Signal**:
   ```go
   <-doneCh
   ```
   - The main goroutine waits to receive a value from `doneCh`. Once it receives the signal, it knows processing is complete and can proceed to print the message count and close the worker.

### Summary

- **`struct{}`**: Defines an empty struct type.
- **`{}`**: Creates an instance of the empty struct.
- **`doneCh <- struct{}{}`**: Sends an empty struct to the channel `doneCh`, signaling without carrying data.
- **Purpose**: Efficient and clear signaling mechanism in concurrent Go programs.


## Kafka Message

A Kafka message is the fundamental unit of data in Apache Kafka, a distributed streaming platform. Each Kafka message is a discrete unit of information that can be produced (sent) by producers and consumed (read) by consumers. Here's a detailed breakdown of what a Kafka message is and what it consists of:

### Kafka Message Components

1. **Key**:
   - **Purpose**: Used to determine the partition within a topic where the message will be stored.
   - **Optional**: It can be null.
   - **Usage**: If a key is provided, Kafka uses the key to hash and determine the partition. If no key is provided, Kafka assigns the message to a partition in a round-robin fashion.

2. **Value**:
   - **Purpose**: The actual data payload of the message.
   - **Content**: It can be any data, often serialized into formats such as JSON, Avro, or Protobuf.
   - **Usage**: Consumers read the value to process the information contained in the message.

3. **Topic**:
   - **Purpose**: A logical channel to which messages are sent and from which messages are received.
   - **Usage**: Topics help organize and separate different streams of data. For example, one topic might be for user registrations, while another might be for user activity logs.

4. **Partition**:
   - **Purpose**: A sub-division of a topic that allows for parallel processing and scalability.
   - **Usage**: Partitions enable Kafka to scale horizontally and distribute the load among multiple brokers. Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of messages.

5. **Offset**:
   - **Purpose**: A unique identifier for each message within a partition.
   - **Usage**: Offsets allow consumers to track their position in the stream and ensure they process each message exactly once or at least once, depending on the processing guarantees required.

### Example of a Kafka Message

Here is an example of what a Kafka message might look like in code, particularly when using the Sarama library in Go:

```go
msg := &sarama.ProducerMessage{
    Topic: "notifications",               // The topic where the message will be sent
    Key:   sarama.StringEncoder("1234"),  // Optional key, here as a string
    Value: sarama.StringEncoder("Hello, Kafka!"), // The message value or payload
}
```

### Role in Kafka

- **Producers**: Applications that send messages to Kafka topics.
- **Consumers**: Applications that read messages from Kafka topics.
- **Brokers**: Kafka servers that store the data and serve clients. Each broker hosts one or more partitions for each topic.
- **Topics**: Categories or channels to which messages are published and from which messages are consumed.

### Message Flow in Kafka

1. **Producing a Message**:
   - A producer creates a message with a key (optional), value, and specifies the topic.
   - The producer sends the message to a Kafka broker.
   - The broker assigns the message to a partition within the topic, using the key to determine the partition if provided.

2. **Storing a Message**:
   - The message is appended to the log of the determined partition.
   - Each message within a partition gets a unique offset.

3. **Consuming a Message**:
   - A consumer subscribes to a topic and reads messages from one or more partitions.
   - The consumer keeps track of the offsets of the messages it has read to ensure it processes each message correctly.

### Example in the Context of Your Code

Take this code, where the Kafka message is created and sent, for example:

```go
msg := &sarama.ProducerMessage{
    Topic: KafkaTopic,                             // The topic to send the message to
    Key:   sarama.StringEncoder(strconv.Itoa(toUser.ID)),  // The key, in this case, the ID of the receiving user
    Value: sarama.StringEncoder(notificationJSON),  // The value, here the JSON-encoded notification
}

_, _, err = producer.SendMessage(msg)  // Sends the message using the Kafka producer
```

- **Topic**: `"notifications"` indicates the logical channel for messages about notifications.
- **Key**: `toUser.ID` helps Kafka determine the partition to store the message.
- **Value**: `notificationJSON` is the actual data payload that contains the notification details.

This structure ensures that messages are organized, easily retrievable, and efficiently processed by consumers.







## Payload

In the context of a Kafka message, the "payload" refers to the actual data being transmitted within the message. It is the main content or body of the message that holds the information you want to send from the producer to the consumer.

### Key Points about Payload

1. **Data Content**: 
   - The payload contains the meaningful data that your application needs to transmit. This can be any type of data, such as text, JSON, binary data, etc.

2. **Serialization**: 
   - The payload is often serialized into a format suitable for transmission and storage, such as JSON, Avro, or Protobuf. Serialization converts the data into a byte sequence that can be easily sent over the network and stored in Kafka.

3. **Deserialization**:
   - On the consumer side, the payload is deserialized back into its original format so it can be processed by the application.

### Example in Code

In the code below, the payload is the JSON-encoded notification:

1. **Creating the Notification Struct**:
   ```go
   notification := models.Notification{
       From: fromUser,
       To:   toUser,
       Message: message,
   }
   ```
   - The `notification` struct contains the information about the sender (`fromUser`), the receiver (`toUser`), and the message content (`message`).

2. **Serializing the Notification**:
   ```go
   notificationJSON, err := json.Marshal(notification)
   if err != nil {
       return fmt.Errorf("failed to marshal notification: %w", err)
   }
   ```
   - The `notification` struct is serialized into a JSON byte slice. This byte slice is the payload that will be sent in the Kafka message.

3. **Creating the Kafka Message with the Payload**:
   ```go
   msg := &sarama.ProducerMessage{
       Topic: KafkaTopic,
       Key:   sarama.StringEncoder(strconv.Itoa(toUser.ID)),
       Value: sarama.StringEncoder(notificationJSON),
   }
   ```
   - The `notificationJSON` byte slice is set as the `Value` of the `sarama.ProducerMessage`. Here, the `Value` field represents the payload.

4. **Sending the Message**:
   ```go
   _, _, err = producer.SendMessage(msg)
   ```
   - The Kafka producer sends the message, and the payload (the JSON-encoded notification) is transmitted to the Kafka topic.

### Summary

- **Payload**: In this context, the payload is the actual data being transmitted within the Kafka message. It is the JSON-encoded notification containing the details of the message sent from one user to another.
- **Importance**: The payload is the main content that consumers will process upon receiving the message from Kafka. It holds the critical information required by the application.





## Route Handler vs Middleware

The `sendMessageHandler` function in the provided code is not a middleware; it is a route handler. In the context of web frameworks like Gin, a route handler is a function that processes a specific HTTP request, while middleware is a function that runs before the route handler and can modify the request, response, or even decide whether to continue to the next middleware or route handler.

### Understanding Route Handler vs. Middleware

#### Route Handler
A route handler is a function that is executed when a specific route is matched. It is responsible for processing the request and generating the response.

**Example of a Route Handler in Gin:**

```go
func sendMessageHandler(producer sarama.SyncProducer, users []models.User) gin.HandlerFunc {
    return func(ctx *gin.Context) {
        fromID, err := getIDFromRequest("fromID", ctx)
        if err != nil {
            ctx.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"message": err.Error()})
            return
        }

        toID, err := getIDFromRequest("toID", ctx)
        if err != nil {
            ctx.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"message": err.Error()})
            return
        }

        err = sendKafkaMessage(producer, users, ctx, fromID, toID)
        if errors.Is(err, ErrUserNotFoundInProducer) {
            ctx.JSON(http.StatusNotFound, gin.H{"message": "User not found"})
            return
        }
        if err != nil {
            ctx.JSON(http.StatusInternalServerError, gin.H{
                "message": err.Error(),
            })
            return
        }

        ctx.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{
            "message": "Notification sent successfully!",
        })
    }
}
```

- **Purpose**: Handles the `/send` route by processing the request and sending a Kafka message.
- **Execution**: It is executed when an HTTP POST request is made to the `/send` endpoint.

#### Middleware
Middleware is a function that runs before the route handler. It can modify the request, response, or perform actions like logging, authentication, or other preprocessing.

**Example of Middleware in Gin:**

```go
func authMiddleware() gin.HandlerFunc {
    return func(ctx *gin.Context) {
        token := ctx.GetHeader("Authorization")
        if token != "valid-token" {
            ctx.AbortWithStatusJSON(http.StatusUnauthorized, gin.H{"message": "Unauthorized"})
            return
        }
        ctx.Next() // Continue to the next handler
    }
}
```

- **Purpose**: Checks if the request has a valid authorization token.
- **Execution**: Runs before the route handler, and can decide whether to continue to the route handler (`ctx.Next()`) or abort the request (`ctx.AbortWithStatusJSON`).

### How They Work Together
In a Gin application, you can have both middleware and route handlers. Middleware can be applied globally to all routes, or to specific groups or individual routes.

**Example with Middleware and Route Handler:**

```go
func main() {
    users := []models.User{
        {ID: 1, Name: "Emma"},
        {ID: 2, Name: "Bruno"},
        {ID: 3, Name: "Rick"},
        {ID: 4, Name: "Lena"},
    }

    producer, err := setupProducer()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("failed to initialize producer: %v", err)
    }
    defer producer.Close()

    gin.SetMode(gin.ReleaseMode)
    router := gin.Default()

    // Apply middleware globally
    router.Use(authMiddleware())

    // Register the route handler
    router.POST("/send", sendMessageHandler(producer, users))

    fmt.Printf("Kafka PRODUCER 📨 started at http://localhost%s\n", ProducerPort)

    if err := router.Run(ProducerPort); err != nil {
        log.Printf("failed to run the server: %v", err)
    }
}
```

- **Middleware**: `authMiddleware` is applied globally, checking the authorization token for all requests.
- **Route Handler**: `sendMessageHandler` processes the `/send` route.

### Summary
- **`sendMessageHandler`**: A route handler function that processes the `/send` route.
- **Middleware**: Functions that run before the route handler to perform preprocessing, such as authentication or logging.

## Kafka Consumer Group and Claims

In the context of Kafka, a "claim" refers to a subset of partitions that a consumer instance is responsible for. When a consumer group is formed, Kafka partitions the topics into smaller pieces called "claims," and each claim is assigned to a consumer instance within the group. This way, the workload is distributed across multiple consumer instances.

Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Consumer Group**:
   - A consumer group is a group of consumer instances which together consume messages from a Kafka topic.
   - Each consumer instance in a consumer group processes a subset of the topic's partitions. This ensures that the load is distributed and messages are processed in parallel.

2. **Partitions**:
   - Kafka topics are divided into partitions for scalability and parallel processing.
   - Each partition can be thought of as an ordered sequence of messages that can be consumed independently.

3. **Claims**:
   - A claim is essentially a subset of these partitions assigned to a single consumer instance.
   - Each consumer instance in the consumer group claims one or more partitions and is responsible for reading messages from them.

### `ConsumeClaim` Method

In the `ConsumeClaim` method of the `sarama.ConsumerGroupHandler` interface, the claim represents the partitions assigned to the consumer for processing.

```go
func (consumer *Consumer) ConsumeClaim(sess sarama.ConsumerGroupSession, claim sarama.ConsumerGroupClaim) error {
	for msg := range claim.Messages() {
		userID := string(msg.Key)
		var notification models.Notification
		err := json.Unmarshal(msg.Value, &notification)
		if err != nil {
			log.Printf("failed to unmarshal notification: %v", err)
			continue
		}
		consumer.store.Add(userID, notification)
		sess.MarkMessage(msg, "")
	}
	return nil
}
```

- **`sess sarama.ConsumerGroupSession`**: Represents the session for this claim, providing context and methods for marking messages as processed.
- **`claim sarama.ConsumerGroupClaim`**: Represents the claim, i.e., the subset of partitions assigned to this consumer instance. It provides access to the messages within these partitions.
- **`for msg := range claim.Messages()`**: Iterates over the messages in the claimed partitions.
- **`sess.MarkMessage(msg, "")`**: Marks a message as processed, allowing Kafka to track the offset and ensure messages are not reprocessed.

### Summary

In Kafka, a claim is the subset of partitions assigned to a consumer instance within a consumer group. This allows for distributed and parallel processing of messages across multiple consumer instances, enhancing scalability and performance. The `ConsumeClaim` method in the Sarama library is where the actual message processing logic is implemented for these claimed partitions.


## Kafka in the Real World

To illustrate Kafka's use of claims in a real-world scenario, consider an example where a Kafka cluster is managing a stream of notifications for a social media platform. Here’s how claims and partitions could be applied:

### Example Scenario

1. **Topic Setup**:
   - The Kafka topic named `notifications` has multiple partitions (`Partition 0`, `Partition 1`, etc.).
   - Each partition contains ordered messages, such as notifications for different users.

2. **Consumer Group**:
   - A consumer group named `notification-consumers` is established to process notifications.
   - Multiple consumer instances (`Consumer A`, `Consumer B`, etc.) subscribe to the `notifications` topic.

3. **Partition Assignment**:
   - Kafka assigns partitions to consumers in the `notification-consumers` group using claims.
   - For example, `Consumer A` may be assigned `Partition 0`, and `Consumer B` may be assigned `Partition 1`.

4. **Processing with Claims**:
   - When `Consumer A` starts, it claims `Partition 0` from the Kafka broker.
   - This means `Consumer A` is responsible for reading and processing messages exclusively from `Partition 0`.

5. **ConsumeClaim Method**:
   - In the `ConsumeClaim` method implementation (as seen in the earlier code), `Consumer A` iterates over messages from `Partition 0`.
   - Each message contains a key (e.g., user ID) and value (e.g., notification details).
   - The method processes each message, extracts relevant information (e.g., user ID), and stores or processes it accordingly (e.g., updating a notification store).

6. **Offset Management**:
   - `Consumer A` uses `sess.MarkMessage(msg, "")` to mark messages as processed.
   - Kafka tracks the offset (position) of the last processed message in each partition.
   - This ensures that if `Consumer A` restarts or fails, it can resume from where it left off without reprocessing messages.

### Use Case Example

- **Scenario**: A social media platform uses Kafka to manage notifications (likes, comments, etc.) for its users.
- **Function**: The `Consumer` instance (`Consumer A`) with the `ConsumeClaim` method reads notifications from `Partition 0` of the `notifications` topic.
- **Implementation**: Messages are processed by extracting user IDs and notification details, updating a local store (`NotificationStore`), and marking messages as processed.

### Benefits of Claims in Kafka

- **Scalability**: Allows multiple consumers to process messages concurrently by partition.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Enables fault tolerance by tracking offsets and allowing consumers to resume from the last processed message.
- **Parallelism**: Distributes workload across partitions, optimizing throughput and performance.

This setup demonstrates how Kafka efficiently handles large-scale message processing through partitioning and claims, ensuring reliability and scalability in real-time data processing scenarios.


## The handleNotifications Function

The `handleNotifications` function is crucial for retrieving and displaying user notifications. Here's a detailed explanation of why it's needed and its real-life use case:

### Purpose of `handleNotifications`

1. **Retrieve Notifications**:
   - The function extracts the user ID from the request.
   - It fetches notifications from the `NotificationStore` associated with that user ID.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - It checks for errors during user ID extraction and returns appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.

3. **Response Formatting**:
   - It formats the response to include notifications, making it easy for clients to consume.
   - If no notifications are found, it returns an empty list with a message.

### Real-Life Use Case

Imagine a social media platform where users receive notifications for various events like friend requests, messages, comments, likes, etc. The `handleNotifications` function would be part of an API endpoint that clients (such as mobile apps or web front-ends) call to fetch notifications for a logged-in user.

### Code Explanation Line-by-Line

```go
func handleNotifications(ctx *gin.Context, store *NotificationStore) {
```
- **Function Definition**: This defines the `handleNotifications` function, which takes two parameters:
  - `ctx`: The Gin context, which contains all the information about the HTTP request.
  - `store`: A pointer to the `NotificationStore` where notifications are stored.

```go
	userID, err := getUserIDFromRequest(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		ctx.JSON(http.StatusNotFound, gin.H{"message": err.Error()})
		return
	}
```
- **Extract User ID**: Calls `getUserIDFromRequest` to extract the user ID from the request parameters. If it fails (e.g., the user ID is missing or invalid), it responds with a 404 Not Found status and an error message.

```go
	notes := store.Get(userID)
	if len(notes) == 0 {
		ctx.JSON(http.StatusOK,
			gin.H{
				"message":       "No notifications found for user",
				"notifications": []models.Notification{},
			})
		return
	}
```
- **Fetch Notifications**: Retrieves notifications from the `NotificationStore` using the extracted user ID. If no notifications are found, it responds with a 200 OK status and an empty list of notifications along with a message.

```go
	ctx.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"notifications": notes})
}
```
- **Return Notifications**: If notifications are found, it responds with a 200 OK status and includes the notifications in the response.

### Real-Life Use Case Example

Consider a social media platform where users can perform actions like posting statuses, commenting, liking posts, etc. Each of these actions generates notifications for the affected users. The `handleNotifications` function would be used as follows:

1. **User Logs In**:
   - The user opens the app and logs in.
   - The app calls the `/notifications` endpoint to fetch the user's notifications.

2. **API Request**:
   - The request hits the server, and the `handleNotifications` function is invoked.

3. **Processing the Request**:
   - The function extracts the user ID from the request context.
   - It fetches notifications for that user from the `NotificationStore`.

4. **Response to Client**:
   - The server responds with the list of notifications (if any) or an appropriate message if there are none.

### Benefits

- **Centralized Notification Management**: Provides a single endpoint for retrieving notifications.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles errors and missing data, providing useful feedback to clients.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps the logic for handling notifications separate from other parts of the application, making the code more modular and maintainable.


## consumer.go code overview

Imagine a notification system in a social media platform. The consumer.go code is part of the backend that listens to a Kafka topic for new notifications, processes these notifications, and stores them for users. When users check their notifications via an API endpoint, they receive the latest notifications processed by this consumer.








### Explanation of `NotificationStore` Struct with Mutex

Let's break down the purpose and functionality of the `NotificationStore` struct and the use of `sync.RWMutex`:

```go
type NotificationStore struct {
	data UserNotifications
	mu   sync.RWMutex
}
```

#### Components of `NotificationStore`

1. **`data UserNotifications`**: 
   - **Purpose**: This field holds the actual data of user notifications. The type `UserNotifications` presumably represents a structure or map that stores notifications for users.
   - **Example**: It could be a map where keys are user IDs and values are slices of notifications or another appropriate data structure.
   
     ```go
     type UserNotifications map[int][]Notification
     ```

2. **`mu sync.RWMutex`**:
   - **Purpose**: This field is a read-write mutex from the `sync` package. It is used to synchronize access to the `data` field, ensuring thread-safe operations.
   - **Usage**: 
     - **Read Lock (`RLock`, `RUnlock`)**: Allows multiple readers to access the data simultaneously, but prevents writers.
     - **Write Lock (`Lock`, `Unlock`)**: Allows only one writer at a time and blocks both readers and other writers.

#### Functionality

The `NotificationStore` struct is designed to store and manage user notifications in a concurrent-safe manner. The `sync.RWMutex` ensures that multiple goroutines can safely read from and write to the `data` without causing race conditions or data corruption.

#### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you might use the `NotificationStore` to safely access and modify the notifications:

```go
// AddNotification adds a notification for a specific user.
func (ns *NotificationStore) AddNotification(userID int, notification Notification) {
	ns.mu.Lock() // Acquire the write lock
	defer ns.mu.Unlock() // Ensure the lock is released after the function returns

	// Append the notification to the user's list of notifications
	ns.data[userID] = append(ns.data[userID], notification)
}

// GetNotifications retrieves all notifications for a specific user.
func (ns *NotificationStore) GetNotifications(userID int) []Notification {
	ns.mu.RLock() // Acquire the read lock
	defer ns.mu.RUnlock() // Ensure the lock is released after the function returns

	// Return the list of notifications for the user
	return ns.data[userID]
}
```

#### Why Use `sync.RWMutex`?

- **Concurrency Safety**: Ensures that the `data` field can be accessed by multiple goroutines safely.
- **Efficiency**: 
  - **Read Lock**: Multiple goroutines can read the data concurrently, improving efficiency.
  - **Write Lock**: Only one goroutine can write at a time, ensuring data integrity.
- **Simplicity**: Using `sync.RWMutex` provides a simple and effective way to manage concurrent read/write access without manually handling lock states.

#### Summary

The `NotificationStore` struct, with its `sync.RWMutex`, is designed to manage user notifications in a thread-safe manner. The mutex ensures that data integrity is maintained by synchronizing access, allowing multiple readers or a single writer at any given time. This is crucial in concurrent applications where multiple goroutines might access or modify shared data simultaneously.


## initializeConsumerGroup vs setupConsumerGroup

The `initializeConsumerGroup` and `setupConsumerGroup` functions in the Kafka consumer application serve different purposes and operate at different levels of abstraction. Here is a breakdown:

### `initializeConsumerGroup` Function

**Purpose**: 
- This function is responsible for creating and configuring a new Kafka consumer group.

**Functionality**:
- **Configures the Consumer Group**: It sets up the necessary configuration for the consumer group using `sarama.NewConfig`.
- **Creates the Consumer Group**: It uses `sarama.NewConsumerGroup` to create the consumer group with the specified Kafka server address, consumer group ID, and configuration.
- **Handles Initialization Errors**: It returns an error if the consumer group cannot be initialized.

**Code**:
```go
func initializeConsumerGroup() (sarama.ConsumerGroup, error) {
	config := sarama.NewConfig()
	consumerGroup, err := sarama.NewConsumerGroup([]string{KafkaServerAddress}, ConsumerGroup, config)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to initialize consumer group: %w", err)
	}
	return consumerGroup, nil
}
```

### `setupConsumerGroup` Function

**Purpose**: 
- This function is responsible for continuously consuming messages from the Kafka topic using the consumer group initialized by `initializeConsumerGroup`. It manages the lifecycle of the consumer group and handles message processing.

**Functionality**:
- **Initializes the Consumer Group**: It calls `initializeConsumerGroup` to create and configure the consumer group.
- **Defines a Consumer**: It creates a new instance of `Consumer`, which holds a reference to the `NotificationStore`.
- **Starts the Consumption Loop**: It enters a loop that continuously consumes messages from the specified Kafka topic.
- **Handles Consumption Errors**: It logs any errors encountered during message consumption and checks if the context has been canceled to exit the loop.

**Code**:
```go
func setupConsumerGroup(ctx context.Context, store *NotificationStore) {
	consumerGroup, err := initializeConsumerGroup()
	if err != nil {
		log.Printf("initialization error: %v", err)
	}
	defer consumerGroup.Close()

	consumer := &Consumer{store: store}

	for {
		err = consumerGroup.Consume(ctx, []string{ConsumerTopic}, consumer)
		if err != nil {
			log.Printf("error from consumer: %v", err)
		}
		if ctx.Err() != nil {
			return
		}
	}
}
```

### Key Differences

1. **Responsibility**:
   - `initializeConsumerGroup`: Focuses on creating and configuring the consumer group.
   - `setupConsumerGroup`: Focuses on managing the consumer group's lifecycle, including initializing it, starting the consumption loop, and handling message processing.

2. **Functionality**:
   - `initializeConsumerGroup`: Only sets up and returns the consumer group.
   - `setupConsumerGroup`: Uses the consumer group to consume messages in a continuous loop and processes these messages.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - `initializeConsumerGroup`: Returns an error if the consumer group cannot be created.
   - `setupConsumerGroup`: Logs errors during message consumption and checks for context cancellation to manage the consumer group's lifecycle.

In summary, `initializeConsumerGroup` is a lower-level function that prepares the consumer group for use, while `setupConsumerGroup` is a higher-level function that manages the ongoing operation of consuming messages from Kafka using the consumer group.
